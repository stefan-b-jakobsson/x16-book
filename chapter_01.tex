\section*{Chapter 1: Overview}

The Commander X16 is a modern home computer in the philosophy of Commodore computers like the VIC-20 and the C64.

\textbf{Features:}
\begin{itemize}
\item 
8-bit 65C02S CPU at 8 MHz (\href{\#future-65c816-support}{*})

\item 
512 KB banked RAM (upgradeable to 2 MB on the X16 Developer Edition)

\item 
512 KB ROM

\item 
Expansion Cards (Gen 1) \& Cartridges (Gen 1 and Gen 2)
\begin{itemize}
\item 
Up to 3.5MB of RAM/ROM

\item 
5 32-byte Memory-Mapped IO slots

\end{itemize}

\item 
VERA video controller
\begin{itemize}
\item 
Up to 640x480 resolution

\item 
256 colors from a palette of 4096

\item 
128 sprites

\item 
VGA, NTSC and RGB output

\item 
Powered by a Lattice ICE40UP5K FPGA

\end{itemize}

\item 
Three sound sources
\begin{itemize}
\item 
Yamaha YM2151: 8 channels, 4-operator FM synthesis

\item 
VERA PSG: 16 channels, 4 waveforms

\item 
VERA PCM: Up to 48 kHz, 16 bit, stereo

\end{itemize}

\item 
Connectivity:
\begin{itemize}
\item 
PS/2 keyboard and mouse

\item 
4 NES/SNES controllers

\item 
SD card

\item 
Commodore Serial Bus ("IEC")

\item 
Many Free GPIOs ("user port")

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

As a modern sibling of the line of Commodore home computers, the Commander X16 is reasonably compatible with computers of that line.
\begin{itemize}
\item 
Pure BASIC programs are fully backwards compatible with the VIC-20 and the C64.

\item 
POKEs for video and audio are not compatible with any Commodore computer. (There are no VIC or SID chips, for example.)

\item 
Pure machine language programs (\$FF81+ KERNAL API) are compatible with Commodore computers.

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Future 65C816 Support}

A future upgrade path for the X16 may involve the 65C816. It is almost fully
compatible with the 65C02 except for 4 instructions (\verb|BBRx|, \verb|BBSx|, \verb|RMBx|, and \verb|SMBx|).
It is advisable not to use these instructions when writing programs for the X16.
